The language of technology is similarly reflected in the Black Wash shampoo unit made from a structural resin finished in black lacquer that creates a sinuous line reflecting an automotive profile. The Torix reception desk and Edo styling station are envisioned through extreme minimal shapes detailed with cast aluminum surfaces and ultra technological finishes.

The collection is titled “Collezione Privata” (private collection) and with the design I have sought to make the salon experience beautiful, personal and intimate. Above all, I believe women’s tools should be jewels, so all elements of the collection while technical equipment is first and foremost beautiful pieces of furniture.“ M. Wanders',
